## Exercise 1: Generic Modal using props.children

- Create a generic modal component. It's job is to simply center its children on the page

- Make a call to the yes/no api (https://yesno.wtf/api) and display 
one of two componenets as the child of the modal component:
- 1. SubscriptionForm component
- 2. SubscriptionMessage component

- While the request is pending, the modal child should be a Loader 
component which just displays a loading message

Think about how to thoroughly separate and isolate the logic within each component. 
The modal children components should not be aware they are placed in a modal. 
Likewise, the modal component should not be aware of the differences between its child components.
