Avocado Toast Bonus Tips
Here are a few easy ways to take your avocado toast up a notch. Pick one or a few!

Add garlic: Lightly rub a peeled raw garlic clove over the top of your toast before adding the avocado, or mix a tiny pinch of garlic powder into the avocado.
Add fresh leafy herbs or your favorite herbed sauce: Chopped fresh basil, cilantro, dill or parsley are all good with avocado. So is a drizzle of pesto, zhoug sauce (spicy cilantro sauce), or chimichurri.
Put an egg on it: I love to top my avocado toast with a fried egg for extra protein (example here). You can do a poached egg or scrambled egg if you prefer.
More extras: Quick-pickled onions or radishes or jalape√±os, your favorite hot sauce, or a sprinkle of sliced cherry tomatoes.
